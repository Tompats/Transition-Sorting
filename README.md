# Transition-Sorting
Experimental program in order to explore A* and UCS algorithm,s in the transition-sorting problem.  

This project was developed for the "Artificial Intelligence" course at the
department of Computer Science and Engineering in University Of Ioannina.

There is no gui, so use the terminal/cmd to run the program.  You just give  
the inputs sepereated with "," and you get the results.
